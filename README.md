A recent report from the Burning Glass Institute and SHRM called “Generative Artificial Intelligence and the Workforce” identifies financial services, law, and marketing research as the industries most likely to be impacted by generative AI.  
In financial services, generative AI can analyze market trends. In law, it can automate document standardization. For marketing professionals, it enables the creation of strategic content.  
Generative AI is poised to affect multiple roles within various sectors.  
Challenges of Generative AI  
One major concern of generative AI is the ethical implications of deepfake technologies. Deepfakes are convincingly real videos and images that mimic real people without their consent.  
Recently, a high school employee was arrested after creating a deepfake audio clip in an attempt to slander the school principal.  
Copyright issues also arise as AI-generated content blurs the lines between original works and derivative creations.  
Additionally, there is the threat of job displacement in various fields as generative AI technologies continue to evolve.  
What are Large Language Models?  
Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of generative AI that generates human-like text.  
These models, such as OpenAI's GPT or Google's BERT, leverage machine learning frameworks called transformers.  
Transformers use a mechanism called self-attention. This allows the models to weigh the importance of different words relative to each other.  
To do this, self-attention looks at each individual word (or partial word) in a body of text. It then determines which are most important to understanding the overall meaning.  
Research from Google illustrated that self-attention could determine the meaning of “it” in different sentences. Source  
A key component of how LLMs learn is through their objective function, which is the model’s overarching goal during training. In many LLMs, the objective function involves predicting the next word in a sentence given the previous words. 
This helps the model learn language patterns and structure.  
LLMs are trained on a vast amount of textual data across many sources, such as books, Wikipedia articles, Reddit posts, and more.  
This training allows them to mimic writing styles, answer questions, and broadly create contextually appropriate text across a variety of applications.  
LLM Applications  
LLMs have a wide range of applications.  
In customer service, LLMs can automate interactions while maintaining a brand’s voice, handling everything from routine inquiries to more complex issues.  
Companies like Freshworks and Zendesk incorporate AI-driven features like chatbots in their customer support services. These tools resolve customer queries and can escalate complex issues to live agents — an example of how LLMs and humans can work together to arrive at better outcomes.  
Customer service companies are using generative AI to streamline and automate resolutions.  
In content creation, LLMs assist writers by generating draft articles, suggesting edits, or creating entirely new pieces of content based on specified guidelines.  
LLMs can also be used for fraud detection, including in the financial sector. For example, J.P. Morgan leverages LLMs for payment validation screening.  
In education, teachers can use LLMs to help build lesson plans, grade assignments, and create personalized plans for students.

Challenges of LLMs  
LLMs pose a number of concerns.  
Like broader generative AI technologies, LLMs pose significant threats to certain industries, such as finance, journalism, and customer support.  
In education and academia, LLMs can enable individuals to cheat on assignments and papers. According to Nature, there have been numerous papers published in journals with the phrase “regenerate response” — indicating the text was copied from an LLM like ChatGPT.  
Data bias is another major challenge, as these LLMs often replicate and amplify biases from their training data. A study published by Apple's Machine Learning Research on four different LLMs highlighted how these models are prone to stereotyping professions based on gender.  
A particularly pressing legal challenge involves copyright infringement issues. LLMs typically require vast amounts of data for training, which they often get by scraping content from various sources, including copyrighted materials without explicit permission. Recently the New York Times and several other US newspapers sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, highlighting the complex ethical and legal landscape that surrounds LLMs.  
LLMs also can generate and spread misleading or false information, posing risks to information integrity and public trust.
